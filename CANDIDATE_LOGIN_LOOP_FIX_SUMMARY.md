# Candidate Login Loop Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The candidate login system was experiencing an infinite redirect loop between the login page (`/login`) and the candidate dashboard (`/candidate/dashboard`). This was causing:

1. Continuous page reloads
2. Poor user experience
3. Potential server overload
4. Inability for candidates to access their dashboard

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by several factors in the authentication flow:

### 1. Race Condition in Auth Context
- The `refreshProfile` function was trying to get both regular user and candidate profiles
- This created a race condition where the candidate state could be set to `null` during loading
- The dashboard component would then redirect to login when `candidat` was `null`

### 2. Multiple Redirect Effects in Login Page
- The login page had multiple `useEffect` hooks that would redirect users
- These effects were running during the authentication loading state
- This caused immediate redirects before the auth state was properly established

### 3. Improper Token Handling
- The auth context wasn't properly distinguishing between candidate and regular user tokens
- Candidate email wasn't being stored consistently for future reference

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Improved Auth Context (`frontend/contexts/auth-context.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added candidate email storage check in `refreshProfile`
- Improved profile fetching logic to prioritize candidate profiles when candidate email is stored
- Added proper error handling for both profile types
- Prevented redirects when already on login page
- Added comprehensive token cleanup in logout function

**Key improvements:**
```typescript
// Check if we have a candidate email stored (indicates candidate login)
const candidateEmail = localStorage.getItem('candidate_email')

if (candidateEmail) {
  // This was a candidate login, try to get candidate profile first
  try {
    const candidatProfile = await apiClient.getCandidatProfile()
    setCandidat(candidatProfile)
    setUser(null)
    return
  } catch (candidatError: any) {
    // Handle candidate profile fetch failure
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Login Page (`frontend/app/login/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `authLoading` state to prevent redirects during authentication loading
- Added loading overlay to prevent user interactions during auth check
- Modified all redirect `useEffect` hooks to check `authLoading` state
- Improved redirect logic to prevent premature redirects

**Key improvements:**
```typescript
// Only redirect when not loading
useEffect(() => {
  if (!authLoading && candidat && !redirecting) {
    router.replace("/candidate/dashboard")
  }
}, [candidat, router, redirecting, authLoading])
```

### 3. Fixed Candidate Dashboard (`frontend/app/candidate/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `hasRedirected` state to prevent multiple redirects
- Added timeout delays to prevent immediate redirects
- Improved error handling and loading states
- Added proper cleanup of error states

**Key improvements:**
```typescript
// Only redirect once to prevent infinite loop
if (!hasRedirected) {
  setHasRedirected(true)
  // ... error handling
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = '/login'
  }, 1000)
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start both backend and frontend servers
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
3. Select "Candidat" mode
4. Login with valid candidate credentials
5. Verify successful redirect to `/candidate/dashboard`
6. Verify no infinite redirect loop occurs

### Automated Testing
Created `test_candidate_auth_fix.py` to verify:
- Candidate login functionality
- Profile retrieval with tokens
- Dashboard access
- Frontend connectivity

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Candidate Login Flow:**
   - User enters credentials
   - Loading state is shown
   - Successful login redirects to dashboard
   - No infinite loops

2. **Authentication State:**
   - Candidate state is properly maintained
   - Tokens are stored correctly
   - Profile refresh works without conflicts

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Invalid credentials show proper error messages
   - Session expiration redirects to login
   - Network errors are handled gracefully

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Fixed authentication flow
2. `frontend/app/login/page.tsx` - Added loading states and improved redirect logic
3. `frontend/app/candidate/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fixed redirect loop prevention
4. `test_candidate_auth_fix.py` - Added test script (new file)
5. `CANDIDATE_LOGIN_LOOP_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation (new file)

## Prevention Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always check loading states** before making authentication decisions
2. **Use proper state management** to prevent race conditions
3. **Implement proper error boundaries** for authentication flows
4. **Add comprehensive testing** for authentication scenarios
5. **Use timeouts and debouncing** for redirect operations

## Conclusion

The login loop issue has been resolved by implementing proper state management, adding loading checks, and improving the authentication flow. The candidate login system should now work reliably without infinite redirects.
