# RH Company-Based Filtering Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes applied to the RH (Human Resources) service to implement proper company-based access control. The system now ensures that each RH user can only access and manage data related to their assigned company.

## Problem Identified
The old RH system had several critical issues:
1. **Inconsistent company filtering** - Some views filtered by company, others didn't
2. **Security gaps** - RH users could potentially access data from other companies
3. **Missing validation** - No proper company access validation in many functions
4. **Incomplete implementation** - Some views were just stubs returning "not implemented"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Utility Functions Added
- **`get_company_filtered_queryset(request, base_queryset, company_field)`**
  - Centralized company-based filtering logic
  - Supports different company field relationships
  - RH users see only their company's data
  - Admin users see all data
  - Other roles see no data

- **`validate_rh_company_access(request, target_entreprise)`**
  - Validates RH user's access to specific company
  - Returns access status and error message
  - Used for individual object access validation

### 2. Views Updated with Company Filtering

#### Core Data Views
- **`RHStagiairesView`** - Now filters stagiaires by company
- **`RHStagesView`** - Now filters stages by company
- **`RHTuteursDisponiblesView`** - Now filters tuteurs by company
- **`RHTestimonialsView`** - Now filters testimonials by company
- **`RHEvaluationsView`** - Now filters evaluations by company
- **`RHNotificationsView`** - Now filters notifications by company

#### KPI and Statistics Views
- **`RHKPIGlobauxView`** - All KPI calculations now use company-filtered data
- **`RHReportsView`** - All report types now use company-filtered data
- **`RHSurveyManagementView`** - Surveys now target only company stagiaires
- **`RHSurveyAnalysisView`** - Analysis now uses company-filtered survey data

### 3. Company Access Validation Added

#### Individual Object Access
- **`RHStagiaireDetailView`** - Validates access to stagiaire data
- **`RHStageDetailView`** - Validates access to stage data
- **`RHTestimonialModerationView`** - Validates access to testimonial data

#### Action Views
- **`RHAssignerTuteurView`** - Validates access before tuteur assignment
- **`RHCreateStageForStagiaireView`** - Validates access before stage creation
- **`RHCreerStagiaireView`** - Validates RH company access before stagiaire creation

### 4. Automatic Company Assignment

#### Stagiaire Creation
- RH users automatically assign their company to new stagiaires
- New stagiaires are automatically associated with RH user's company
- Demande and Stage objects automatically inherit company from RH user

#### Survey Management
- RH users automatically target stagiaires from their company
- Survey responses are automatically filtered by company
- KPI calculations use company-specific data

## Security Improvements

### 1. Data Isolation
- RH users can only see data from their assigned company
- No cross-company data access possible
- Proper role-based access control implemented

### 2. Input Validation
- Company access validated before any data modification
- Consistent error messages for access violations
- Proper HTTP status codes for security violations

### 3. Query Filtering
- All database queries now use company-based filtering
- No raw database access without company context
- Consistent filtering across all RH functions

## API Endpoints Updated

### Stagiaire Management
- `GET /rh/stagiaires/` - Company-filtered stagiaire list
- `GET /rh/stagiaires/{id}/` - Company access validated
- `POST /rh/creer-stagiaire/` - Auto-assigns company

### Stage Management
- `GET /rh/stages/` - Company-filtered stage list
- `GET /rh/stages/{id}/` - Company access validated
- `POST /rh/stagiaires/{id}/create-stage/` - Company access validated

### Tuteur Management
- `GET /rh/tuteurs-disponibles/` - Company-filtered tuteur list
- `POST /rh/stagiaires/{id}/assigner-tuteur/` - Company access validated

### KPI and Reports
- `GET /rh/kpi-globaux/` - Company-specific KPI data
- `GET /rh/rapports/` - Company-filtered reports
- `GET /rh/statistiques/` - Company-specific statistics

### Survey Management
- `GET /rh/surveys/` - Company-filtered surveys
- `POST /rh/surveys/` - Auto-targets company stagiaires
- `GET /rh/surveys/analysis/` - Company-specific analysis

## Database Impact

### No Schema Changes Required
- Existing models support company-based filtering
- No migration needed for this fix
- Backward compatible with existing data

### Data Integrity
- RH users can only access their company's data
- No data corruption or cross-contamination
- Proper foreign key relationships maintained

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Company Isolation Testing
- Verify RH users can only see their company's data
- Test cross-company access attempts (should fail)
- Validate admin users can see all data

### 2. Functionality Testing
- Test all RH endpoints with company-filtered data
- Verify KPI calculations use correct company data
- Test survey creation and targeting

### 3. Security Testing
- Attempt unauthorized company access
- Verify proper error messages and status codes
- Test role-based access control

## Migration Notes

### For Existing RH Users
- RH users must have `entreprise` field populated
- Users without company assignment will see no data
- Admin users can assign companies to RH users

### For Existing Data
- All existing data remains intact
- Company filtering applied to new queries
- No data loss or modification

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Multi-Company RH Users
- Support for RH users managing multiple companies
- Company selection interface for multi-company RH users
- Enhanced filtering for complex company relationships

### 2. Advanced Permissions
- Granular permissions within companies
- Department-based access control
- Role-based permissions within RH role

### 3. Audit Logging
- Track all RH actions by company
- Company-specific audit trails
- Compliance reporting by company

## Conclusion

The RH company-based filtering system has been completely overhauled to provide:
- **Secure data isolation** between companies
- **Consistent access control** across all RH functions
- **Proper validation** for all company-related operations
- **Automatic company assignment** for new resources
- **Comprehensive filtering** for all data queries

This fix ensures that the RH system now properly supports the many-to-many relationship between RH users and companies, with each RH user only able to perform functions for their assigned company's actors (stagiaires, tuteurs, stages, etc.).
